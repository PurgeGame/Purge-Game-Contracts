There is a clear demand from crypto market participants for high-risk investment products which fuse skilled speculation with gambling. These products, overall, have had highly negative returns for most investors. For these gamblevestments to work out, the buyer must win a three-leg parlay: 

1. Is it a scam? These speculators have shown a propensity to pile money into complete scams with a guaranteed -100% ROI. Scams require little effort to produce and, unsurprisingly, the market is saturated with them.

2. Will it generate revenue? Does it make any economic sense at all? The vast majority of these crypto products cannot answer the fundamental question: Why would anyone want this shit? If the only answer is "some idiot might want to buy it for more later" then an economic death spiral is inevitable once you run out of idiots.

3. If the project is a complete success, will the revenue flow to my investments or just into the dev's pockets? Even if a crypto scheme isn't a scam and does show a real profit, the creators have no inherent incentive to reward early investors.

Degenerus Protocol answers the first and third questions in a verifiable and trustless manner. Every aspect of the ecosystem is on-chain, open source and immutably deployed. The admin has no meaningful powers or responsibilities. All flows of money, under every possible circumstance, are tranparently defined by the code. 

Degenerus cannot be a scam because it does not ask for your trust. The only promise is that the code is law. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS IS A GAMBLING PRODUCT WITH INTENTIONALLY HIGH RISK OF TOTAL LOSS. SIGNING ANY TRANSACTION WITH MY CONTRACTS IS AN ACKNOWLEGEMENT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE RULES AND RISKS OF THE PROTOCOL, INCLUDING ANY BUGS.

The shitcoin market demonstrates demand for crypto gambling and gamblevesting; Degenerus Protocol offers a synthetic alternative, one carefully designed to have self-reinforcing incentives and continually growing jackpots. The protocol is designed to reward players who strengthen the system by investing early in a cycle, playing regularly and referring new users. Other players will have a negative expectation, but the primary determinant of outcomes will always be luck.

Importantly, there is zero rake; instead the gambling is subsidized and positive-sum overall. This means that any money lost by one player is always captured by another, never by the house. The economic model is based on the system accumulating a continually increasing amount of ethereum and swapping it for Lido stETH, returning a reliable ethereum yield. This yield is the revenue used to pay bondholders and subsidize the prize pool. At the end of every 100-level cycle, most of the accumulated ETH will be returned to the players in jackpots rewarding their participation level.
